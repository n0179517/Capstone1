            <img src="images/classic.png" alt="Classic">
            <p>Our classic hard cider has a crisp and refreshing taste with a subtle sweetness derived from the apples. It often has a tartness that balances the sweetness and a hint of acidity that provides a refreshing zing. The taste profile comes from our Washington grown apples, which gives it a light, fruity and easy-drinking flavor.</p>

            <h6>Semi-Dry</h6>
            <img src="images/dry.png" alt="Dry">
            <p>A more subdued sweetness than semi-sweet hard cider, with a drier finish. It has a medium to full body and a moderate level of carbonation that gives it a smooth mouthfeel. The natural apple flavors are more prominent in semi-dry hard cider, and it has a crisp and refreshing taste with a subtle tartness.</p>

            <h6>Semi-Sweet</h6>
            <img src="images/semiSweet.png" alt="Sweet">
            <p>This cider has a balanced taste that is both sweet and tart. It has a fuller body than the classic hard cider, and a moderate to high level of carbonation that gives it a lively mouthfeel. The sweetness is more prominent in semi-sweet hard cider, but it is still well-balanced with the natural acidity of the apples.</p>
