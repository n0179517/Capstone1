        <h2>Welcome to Our House</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to our cider house, where we craft some of the finest ciders using traditional methods and locally-sourced ingredients. Our story began with a passion for cider-making and a desire to share our love for this delicious drink with others. We take great pride in creating ciders that are not only flavorful but also reflect the unique characteristics of the apples grown in our region.
        </p>
        <p>
            At our cider house, we believe in producing ciders that are authentic, natural, and sustainably made. We use only the freshest apples and never add artificial flavors, colors, or sweeteners to our products. Our cider-making process involves a blend of traditional techniques and modern technology, resulting in ciders that are both consistent in quality and distinct in flavor. We welcome you to come and visit our cider house, try our ciders, and experience the true taste of the Pacific Northwest.
